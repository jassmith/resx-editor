# RESX Editor

This is a previewer/light-weight editor for string-based RESX/RESW files commonly used for localization for .NET applications. As with most of my projects this started as a learning experiment and thus is not feature rich. But it is MIT licensed, so please, by all means contribute!

## Features

Pretty simple really, if you open a .resx/.resw file from your workspace, you have the option of using this by default for the viewer and it will show the contents in a data grid format:

### Disabling the editor
To disable this right click on a `resx` or `resw` file and choose `Open with...` and change options:
